+We can limit `unsafe' to only a small portion of code that we can easily check, leaving rest of the code safe Rust. It's hard to enforce the same constraint in C.

+Because `malloc' returns a pointer that is aligned for any kind of type. It must return a pointer that is aligned to max alignment, which is 2*sizeof(int).

+It saves the list pointers in place. Because we are implementing the allocator, it's hard to dynamically allocate some space for storing the linked list.

+In C, the size is kept put before the memory address. In Rust, size and alignment is passed into `dealloc', so its implementation can be simplified, and size of the buffer is saved elsewhere e.g. len in String.
